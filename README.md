Obtaining and Building
----------------------

If you're mad enough, the LaTeX documents and analyses can be rebuilt from scratch. You'll need a reasonable *NIX environment with R 3.0, build tools and a decent TeX distribution.

Simply execute:

    git clone https://github.com/adrcooper/tasks.git
    cd tasks
    make all

If all goes well, the final paper.pdf file can be found in the doc/ directory.
