% Wage inequality rising since 1960s, especially in the top half of the earnings distribution. In the United States, where real wages for unskilled workers have declined, on average, since 1970, the skill premium for college graduates has grown significantly. But changing distribution of education doesn't explain the rise in inequality. Robust to industry (shown with census data.)

% Causes of SBTC include (a) cheaper capital/computers, (b) institutional changes. Skills can be considered (a) complement physical+computer capital, or (b) particular skills needed for rapid change. Other explanations incude international openness and trade, increasing competition for jobs at low end of spectrum. Further, labor institutions are changing, especially weaker unions.
                
%US, Canadian and British experience particularly pronounced. Europe experienced similar increase in inequality; borne out more in unemployment than wage (institutional explanation.) The key explanation has been skill-based technical change, which is increasingly rapid due to the pace of technical advances. Supply of skilled workers sped up in 1970s, slowed in 1980s; under this explanation, excess of demand gives wage increase.

% Industry-level evidence: all industries increase in skill demand, skill premium. Change more rapid in industries with increasing computerization.

% In a study of the Australian workforce, \citet{Esposto2012} decomposed the Australian workforce by type of labour, and found that, over time, the labour force is upskilling, but that the trend depends on the category of work being performed. Between XXXX and XXXX, the demand for managerial and professional tasks increased, but over the same period, 

% The task-assignment model allocates high (H), medium (M) and low (L) skilled inputs on a unit interval. Computerisation, due to decr in cost of computing power, in routine tasks displaces the H/M and M/L boundary. Wage of M decreases, wage of H and L increase due to q-complementarity.

% Major within-data limitations. Key: changing composition of tasks within jobs. Subject to continual optimisation. More recent literature considers actual tasks in jobs through surveys.
        
% Also, endogenous task choice not considered by literature; should not assume assignment to skills are predetermined.
        
% Further, orthogonal category: "offshorability."


%The college premium is linked to the supply of labor by \cite{Card2001}. They note that the rising college premium measured in the data is attributable almost entirely to younger cohorts of workers, and especially for men in their early thirties. They argue that the driving force behind the rising college premium is a slowdown in the pace of educational attainment, relative to the demand for labor.

Empirically, we take as our point of departure the analysis of the US occupational wage structure performed by \citet{Fortin2011}, who build on the work of \citet{Oaxaca1973} and \citet{Juhn1993} to decompose the impact of demographic variables and occupational tasks on the wage structure. Following \citet{Autor2012} and \citet{Fortin2011}, we assume that workers self-select into occupations based on comparative advantage, in a model reminiscent of Roy's (\citeyear{Roy1951}) model of occupational choice.


%We will take as a point of departure the standard model for analyzing skill-based technical change (SBTC). This model, dubbed the `canonical' model by \citet{Acemoglu2011} and which has sparked a voluminous literature, has enjoyed considerable empirical success explaining rising wages for high-skill managerial and professional jobs in the United States and Europe \citep{Katz1992}. Since the canonical model includes \emph{factor-augmenting} capital, it predicts a uniform skill upgrading of the work force at all education levels \citep{Levy2003}. Skill upgrading has been confirmed by a number of authors, both in Australia \citep{Esposto2012, Wooden2000, Cully1999} and overseas \citep{Autor2008}. 


% \citet{Autor2009} analyze an economy where rising demand for service occupations 


Both the `canonical' model and the Ricardian models of occupational choice discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:2} make predictions about the proportion of skilled and unskilled labor employed, in the presence of SBTC.
