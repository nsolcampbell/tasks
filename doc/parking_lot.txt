% Wage inequality rising since 1960s, especially in the top half of the earnings distribution. In the United States, where real wages for unskilled workers have declined, on average, since 1970, the skill premium for college graduates has grown significantly. But changing distribution of education doesn't explain the rise in inequality. Robust to industry (shown with census data.)

% Causes of SBTC include (a) cheaper capital/computers, (b) institutional changes. Skills can be considered (a) complement physical+computer capital, or (b) particular skills needed for rapid change. Other explanations incude international openness and trade, increasing competition for jobs at low end of spectrum. Further, labor institutions are changing, especially weaker unions.
                
%US, Canadian and British experience particularly pronounced. Europe experienced similar increase in inequality; borne out more in unemployment than wage (institutional explanation.) The key explanation has been skill-based technical change, which is increasingly rapid due to the pace of technical advances. Supply of skilled workers sped up in 1970s, slowed in 1980s; under this explanation, excess of demand gives wage increase.

% Industry-level evidence: all industries increase in skill demand, skill premium. Change more rapid in industries with increasing computerization.

% In a study of the Australian workforce, \citet{Esposto2012} decomposed the Australian workforce by type of labour, and found that, over time, the labour force is upskilling, but that the trend depends on the category of work being performed. Between XXXX and XXXX, the demand for managerial and professional tasks increased, but over the same period, 

% The task-assignment model allocates high (H), medium (M) and low (L) skilled inputs on a unit interval. Computerisation, due to decr in cost of computing power, in routine tasks displaces the H/M and M/L boundary. Wage of M decreases, wage of H and L increase due to q-complementarity.

% Major within-data limitations. Key: changing composition of tasks within jobs. Subject to continual optimisation. More recent literature considers actual tasks in jobs through surveys.
        
% Also, endogenous task choice not considered by literature; should not assume assignment to skills are predetermined.
        
% Further, orthogonal category: "offshorability."


%The college premium is linked to the supply of labor by \cite{Card2001}. They note that the rising college premium measured in the data is attributable almost entirely to younger cohorts of workers, and especially for men in their early thirties. They argue that the driving force behind the rising college premium is a slowdown in the pace of educational attainment, relative to the demand for labor.

Empirically, we take as our point of departure the analysis of the US occupational wage structure performed by \citet{Fortin2011}, who build on the work of \citet{Oaxaca1973} and \citet{Juhn1993} to decompose the impact of demographic variables and occupational tasks on the wage structure. Following \citet{Autor2012} and \citet{Fortin2011}, we assume that workers self-select into occupations based on comparative advantage, in a model reminiscent of Roy's (\citeyear{Roy1951}) model of occupational choice.


%We will take as a point of departure the standard model for analyzing skill-based technical change (SBTC). This model, dubbed the `canonical' model by \citet{Acemoglu2011} and which has sparked a voluminous literature, has enjoyed considerable empirical success explaining rising wages for high-skill managerial and professional jobs in the United States and Europe \citep{Katz1992}. Since the canonical model includes \emph{factor-augmenting} capital, it predicts a uniform skill upgrading of the work force at all education levels \citep{Levy2003}. Skill upgrading has been confirmed by a number of authors, both in Australia \citep{Esposto2012, Wooden2000, Cully1999} and overseas \citep{Autor2008}. 


% \citet{Autor2009} analyze an economy where rising demand for service occupations 


Both the `canonical' model and the Ricardian models of occupational choice discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:2} make predictions about the proportion of skilled and unskilled labor employed, in the presence of SBTC.

Figure~\ref{fig:rif} presents the results of unconditional quantile regressions of task measures against the occuptional wage profile, afer accounting for demographic and human capital variables.\footnote{Eight dummies for potential experience, education, sex and martial status are included.} On the left-hand side, the first classification scheme is illustrated, and on the right, the second. The top row shows the base period (1981/82 and 2000/01, respectively), and the bottom row shows 2011/12 for both classification schemes. The horizontal axis shows the quantiles of the (real) wage distribution, and the vertical axis is measured in log points per scale unit. 95\% confidence intervals are shaded, so that at each quantile, statistical signficiance is indicated by the shaded area not overlapping the horizontal axis.\footnote{Note that, since task measure scale units are essentially arbitrary, it is not meaningful to compare different task measures vertically.}

Figure~\ref{fig:rif} illustrates two important facts. First, notice that the marginal task impact curves differ between periods. Consequently, a unit change in occupational task measures is associated with a different impact on wage quantiles at the start and end of both periods. We will focus on these differences, below. Second, notice that marginal effects for each period and task measure appear to be related to quantiles (the x-axis) in a complex way. At this stage, we can conclude that the association between the wage distribution and task measures is highly nonlinear, and that the simple model estimated in \eqref{eq:translog} is not rich enough to capture the changes over time in the wage distribution.

% *** describe the cross-sectional patterns in broad brushstrokes here ***

Although their shapes are indicative, the difference between the marginal task effects between periods,
$$\partial\ln(w^q_{T=1})/\partial TC_i-\partial\ln(w^q_{T=0})/\partial TC_i,$$
need to be interpreted with care. Recall from the previous dicusssion that observed changes in the marginal income distribution can occur over time for two reasons. First, a change in the composition of the population of individuals self-selecting into occupations. If, for instance, individuals with a higher degree of human capital were to self-select into occupations with a higher level of a particular task measure, then the observed marginal effect of that task measure would increase. This change corresponds to the $\Delta_X$ term of \eqref{eq:odecomp}. The second component of changes in the marginal effect of task measures is associated with structural changes in the occupational wage structure, denoted $\Delta_S$. In the following section, we now formally de-compose the changes in the occupational wage structure into these two components.
