\chapter{Tasks and wages}

In the previous two chapters, we have seen that the `canonical' model of skill-biased technical change does a poor job of explaining the evolution of wage inequality in Australia. In particular, while growing inequality the Australian labour market has mirrored that of overseas economies, there is no empirical evidence that this has been driven by a premium paid to `educated' workers, relative to less educated workers. 

The evidence presented in Chapters~2~and~3 lend weight to Goos~\&~Manning's~(\citeyear{Goos2007}) more `nuanced' interpretation of skill-biased technical change. While educational attainment may explain only little between-group inequality, the data seem to suggest an association between occupational affiliation and the widening wage distribution. This explanation suggests that it is specific attributes of these occupations, and not the education required to undertake them, that explains changes in the wage share. Specifically, it is the `middle-skill' or `routine' occupations described by \citet{Levy2003} and \citet{Goos2009} that can be out-sourced by firms or automated by investments in labour-saving capital equipment. Under this hypothesis, specific attributes of these jobs allow them to be replaced or outsourced, shifts firms' demand curves for these types of labour to the left. As a result of an excess of supply over demand, wages in these occupations are bid down, and wages are both compressed and reduced. 

The analysis presented in Chapter~3 relies on a somewhat arbitrary three-way division of occupations, and presents only correlations between the wage share and capital. Further, this statistical correlation cannot establish a causative relationship between the shrinking wage share of middle-income jobs, and a rising capital-output ratio for the industry. Clearly, a more rigorous analysis is required to demonstrate a clear relationship between tangible properties of middle-skilled jobs and falling wages.

In this chapter, we present a more rigorous analysis, using data on occupational task content compiled by the U.S. Department of Labor to determine which occupations are likely candidates for automation and off-shoring. This data, made available as part of the O*NET database, provides measures of the types of tasks specific occupations entail. Adapting a procedure developed by JK as an extension to \citet{Levy2003}, who adapt the US Dictionary of Occupational Titles, the predecessor to O*NET, to compile indexes for `offshorability' and `routinsation.' These indexes provide a quantiative foundation for comparing changes in the wage distribution and occupations at risk of structural change due to the processes of `offshorability' and `routinisation.'

Empirically, we take as our point of departure the analysis of the US occupational wage structure performed by \citet{Fortin2011}, who build on the work of \citet{Oaxaca1973} and \citet{Juhn1993} to decompose the impact of demographic variables and occupational tasks on the wage structure. Following \citet{Autor2012} and \citet{Fortin2011}, we assume that workers self-select into occupations based on comparative advantage, in a model reminiscent of Roy's (\citeyear{Roy1951}) model of occupational choice.

In the previous two chapters, we assumed little about the functional relationship between specific skills and wages. Decomposition methods are especially powerful because they are able to extract relatively rich information from the data. This strength comes at the price of relatively strong assumptions imposed on the data in order to guarantee parameter identification; the limitations these assumptions bring are shared by all decomposition methods. These assumptions are discussed in detail in section~\ref{sec:id}, and mostly stem from the fact that decompositions provide only `shallow' analyses of economic phenomena, and are not able to model `deep,' structural properties of the labour market. The most important of these restrictions, and possibly the least palatable, is the following. Despite motivating our model with Roy's model, a general-equilibrium framework, the empirical analysis presented below assumes that general equilibrium effects are completely dominated by first-order effects, so that market outcomes in each occupation's labour market depends only on the supply and demand for skills in that occupation.\footnote{Within a general equilibrium framework, this assumption is equivalent to the assumption of diagonal dominance \citep[p.233]{Arrow1971}.} This assumption is questionable: it is quite likely, for example, that a collapse in the demand for labour in one occupation, would cause some workers to change their occupational affiliations, triggering a shift in the supply of labour in other occupations. Nonetheless, this and other assumptions we employ below are standard in the inequality literature \citep[p.1]{Fortin2011}. These limitations will be discussed in greater detail, below.

\section{Roy's Model of Occupational Choice}
The economic intuition behind this analysis stems from Roy's~(\citeyear{Roy1951}) model of self-selection, where individuals are endowed with heterogeneous skills, and can select between multiple occupations according to their own comparative advantage. The model is sophisticated enough to handle any number of occupations, and distributions of individual skill. For our purposes, let us consider Roy's original simple thought experiment, a remote village where individuals with heterogeneous skills must choose between just two occupations: hunting rabbits and fly fishing. 

The level of skill required to practise these jobs is quite different: hunting rabbits, which are described as `slow and stupid,' is easy. As a result, the returns to rabbit hunting skills is not particularly great: skilled trappers will not catch many more than unskilled trappers. Fly fishing, by contrast, is extremely difficult. In this occupation, the return to skill is considerable: unskilled fishermen will hardly catch anything, but those who have mastered the art can make a good living.

In the model, the wage accrued to each activity arises from the sale of what is caught. Both fish and rabbits fetch a well-known market price, and an individual's wage is determined simply by the product of the market price and the size of the catch. It is assumed that individuals make their labour supply decisions based only on their wage; if the distribution of each type of skill is continuous, then individual agents will almost never be indifferent to any two activities.

Roy's intention was to explain the {\em selection effect}, or the difference in productivity of individuals in a given occupation relative to the population mean, as a result of their own self-selection decisions. For illustrative purposes, we present here a simple parametric example with two occupations from \citet{Heckman2008}. Although this simple example has considered only two occupations, Roy models can be generalized to any number occupations; the intention here is to illustrate the intuition behind the model, rather than derive a general result. Assume first that individual $i$'s efficiency follows a bivariate normal distribution with covariance $\ve{\Sigma}$, where an individual would catch either $F_i$ fish, or $R_i$ rabbits, depending on the occupation selected:
\begin{equation*}
 \begin{bmatrix}log{F_i} & log{R_i}\end{bmatrix}' \sim N(\bmu, \ve{\Sigma}),
 \label{eq:dist}
\end{equation*}
where $\ve{\Sigma}$ is not necessarily diagonal. If the market prices for fish and rabbits are $\pi_f$ and $\pi_r$ respectively, then it can then be shown that the average productivity in each sector is
\begin{align}
 E\left[ log(F_i) | \pi_fF_i \geq \pi_rR_i \right]
   &= \mu_f + \frac{\sigma_{ff} - \sigma_{fr}}{\sigma}
     \lambda\left(
       \frac{log(\pi_f) - log(\pi_r) + \mu_f - \mu_r}{\sigma}
       \right)
\label{eq:srf}
\intertext{for fishing, and}
 E\left[ log(R_i) | \pi_rR_i \geq \pi_fF_i \right]
   &= \mu_r + \frac{\sigma_{rr} - \sigma_{rf}}{\sigma}
     \lambda\left(
       \frac{log(\pi_r) - log(\pi_f) + \mu_r - \mu_f}{\sigma}
       \right)
\label{eq:srr}
\end{align}
for rabbit hunting, where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of individuals' skill ratios, $\log(F_i/R_i)$, and $\lambda(\cdot)$ is the inverse Mills ratio.

The second terms on the right-hand sides of \eqref{eq:srf} and \eqref{eq:srr} are {\em selection effects}, and must be positive for at least one of the occupations. Specifically, the selection effect is positive for occupations with high skill variance, that is, those occupations that reward high skill levels and punish low skill levels. Whether there is positive selection into occupations with {\em lower} variance depends on the covariance with other skills ($\sigma_{fr}$ in this example.)

Equations \eqref{eq:srr} and \eqref{eq:srf} yield rather intuitive comparative static predictions in the event of a market price change for one of the goods. In the event of a price shock (which may result from a shift in either demand or supply), agents will self-select into the market where prices have increased. For example, if the relative log price of rabbits ${\left(\log(\pi_r)-\log(\pi_f)\right)}$ increases, {\em ceteris paribus}, then ${\pi_rR_i \geq \pi_fF_i}$ will be true for some proportion of marginal agents who had formerly been better off fishing. These marginal agents will transfer into the rabbit-hunting occupation, which has a secondary effect of reducing the observed wage dispersion in the fishing occupation.

This intuitive comparative static prediction forms the basis for the empirical analysis we undertake in this chapter. If the polarization hypothesis suggested in previous chapters is correct, then the demand for routine and offshorable occupations should have decreased in the period 1981-2010. As wages fall, individuals transfer into other occupations, and consequently a decrease in both the level and dispersion of wages in these occupation should be observed.

%As shall be discussed below, the key challenges arising out of empirical implementations of model of this type is identification. If the profit maximization and log-normality assumptions can be maintained, and if wages are observable in each sector, then the model is identified. However, when a Roy model is used to analyze a labour supply decision, where wages for the household sector are {\em not} observable, and nor are the talents of individuals, then the parameters in \eqref{eq:sr} are not identified. In this case, variations {\em across } markets, or variations {\em within } markets (ie across individuals) are used to identify the model.

\section{Empirical Approach}\label{sec:emp}

The desired decomposition is a relationship between occupations and their constituent tasks. Roy-type models posit that the wage an individual is paid depends on the skills demanded by that occupation, and the returns to the skills in question. One simple approach to identifying the contribution of each one of a worker's skills to the overall wage, considered by \citet{Firpo2011}, is to adapt the simple linearly additive functional form of \citet{Welch1969}. Welch assumed that an individual's wage is determined linearly by the individual skills that worker possessed.
\begin{assumption}[Linear additivity of returns to skills] \label{ass:linear}
  An individual $i$'s wage in occupation $j$ at time $t$ is set according to the sum of the returns $r_{jk}$ to skills $k$, $k=1,\dots,K$ required for that occupation:
\begin{equation}
  w_{ijt} = \theta_{jt} + \sum_{k=1}^K r_{jkt}S_{ik} + u_{ijt}, \label{eq:linear}
\end{equation}
Where $\theta_{jt}$ is a `base pay' term, and $u_{ijt}\sim i.i.d$ captures idiosyncratic characteristics of each worker. 
\end{assumption}

This is a strong assumption, which enjoys limited empirical support. Linear additivity implies that the labour market in each occupation is free of general equilibrium effects arising from changes in other occupational wage structures.

Notice that in \eqref{eq:linear}, the returns to skill $k$ are particular to occupation $j$. This makes intuitive sense: since each individual is endowed with a particular mix of skills, which may not necessarily be useful in that individual's chosen occupation, there is no reason to expect the returns to certain skills to equilibrate across markets. In Roy's example above, fly fishing skills of any level do not earn a return for workers engaged in rabbit hunting. % literature rejecting skill bundling

\citet{Firpo2011} perform two separate analyses of changes in the occupational wage. The first, outlined below, directly analyses the occupational wage profile as quantiles.

\subsection{Changes in the Wage Profile: A Direct Analysis} 

As a first step in the analysis, we directly analyze the relationship between occupational task measures and changes in the aggregate occupational wage profile. Under the maintained assumption that wages are linearly separable, it follows that changes in the occupational returns to a particular skill $r_{jk}$ will be observable in the aggregate wage profile.

Estimating a similar model of wage profiles, \citet{Juhn1993} suggested that, in regressions on occupational wage quantiles, a worker's rank was a good instrument for that worker's ability. Thus, in aggregate, a fixed quantile effect $\lambda^q$ across groups could be interpreted as an aggregate measurement of changing returns to ability. We first estimate changes in the wage quantiles, for each occupation $j$ and each quantile $q$,
\begin{equation} 
  \Delta w_j^q = a_j + b_jw_{j0}^q + \lambda^q + \epsilon^q_j, 
\end{equation}
where $\lambda^q$ is an estimate of returns-to-skill at each quantile $q$. Under the maintained assumption that the returns to skill at each quantile of the wage distribution is independent of the actual occupation, then the parameters $a_j$ and $b_j$ describe the changes in each occupation over the study period.

The next step in the analysis is to decompose these changes according to the task we are interested in. These task measures, defined below, capture the ability to off-shore or automate an occupation. Applying the first-step regressions defined above, we are now in a position to test the relationship between changes in occupational wage profiles and task indexes:
\begin{align}
  \hat{a}_j &= \gamma_0 + \sum_{h=1}^K\gamma_{jh}TC_{jh} + \mu_j, \\
  \hat{b}_j &= \delta_0 + \sum_{h=1}^K\delta_{jh}TC_{jh} + \nu_j.
\end{align}
\subsection{The Decomposition Approach}
The next step in the analysis is to decompose changes in the log wage distribution according, according to task index measures. The decomposition methods upon which this study is based were first considered by \citet{Oaxaca1973} and \citet{Blinder1973}. 

Consider some outcome variable, such as an average log wage, that differs for two disjoint groups. Oaxaca, for instance, considered the difference in mean wages paid to men and women. Let the difference in the mean wage for men and women be $\Delta$:
\begin{equation} \Delta = E[\ln y_m] - E[\ln y_f]. \label{eq:odec} \end{equation}
If $\Delta$ is nonzero, this might be explainable by (a) factors arising from different human capital endowments in each group, (b) factors arising purely from the fact of group membership, or (c) both. The goal of the Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decomposition is to divide this difference into two components: the component explainable by human capital factors (the endowment effect), and a structural component attributable only to group membership.

To determine the influence of sex on the mean of the wage distribution, Oaxaca considered two separate regression models, one for each sex. Each vector $X_i$ of covariates included demographic and human capital variables such as years of education, work experience and age:
$$  \ln y_{g,i} = \ve{X}_{g,i}'\vbeta_g + \epsilon_{g,i} \quad \text{where}\ g=M,F. $$
Then, taking expectations of both sides and substituting into \eqref{eq:odec}, the difference of expected log wages can be decomposed as,
\begin{align}
  \Delta_O &= E[X_m]'\vbeta_m -  E[X_f]'\vbeta_f \notag \\
  &= \underbrace{E[X_m]'(\vbeta_m - \vbeta_f)}_{\Delta_S} + \underbrace{(E[X_m]'-E[X_f]')\vbeta_f}_{\Delta_X}. \label{eq:odecomp}
\end{align}
The second term of this decomposition, $\Delta_X$, is the difference in mean log wages that can be explained by human capital factors (the `endowments effect'). The other term, $\Delta_S$, represents the `structural' difference in wages between the two groups. In the case where the wages of males and females are being considered, this term can be interpreted as the sex discrimination differential. The parameters in \eqref{eq:odecomp} are computed at their means to determine the difference $E[X_m]'(\vbeta_m - \vbeta_f)$ attributable to discrimination, in the mean log wage.

In the study at hand, the object of interest is the distribution of wages, rather than differences in the conditional mean, and the two groups of interest are not gender groups, but rather two different time periods, corresponding to periods when the Survey of Income and Housing was conducted: 1981-2 and 2009-10. For simplicity, we refer to these time periods as $T=0$ and $T=1$, respectively. The explanatory variables of interest in this case is a matrix of task content indexes, for each occupation. The procedure for constructing these indexes is described in the data appendix, Section~\ref{sec:onet}.

\subsubsection{Unconditional Quantile Regression}
One major shortcoming of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition is that only the conditional means of a wage distribution, $E(Y|X)$, and its counterfactual can be compared. Recall that, in the Roy model described above, changes in the profitability of any occupation should result in the more efficient individuals self-selecting out of an occupation. The mean of a wage distribution is a poor instrument for observing this phenomenon: rather, any polarisation effect will be observed in the overall {\em distribution} of wages, $F_Y$. Ideally, we would like to compute a decomposition similar to \eqref{eq:odecomp}, but which decomposes changes in the $\alpha$th quantile of the wage distribution, $q_\tau(F_Y)$. Such a decomposition was considered by \citet{Firpo2011}; it is their technique, as described in \citet{Firpo2009}, that we apply here.

Under our decomposition, the wage of an individual $i$ is observed in one of two periods, $T=0$ or $T=1$. Under the hypothesis of wage polarisation, we will assume that individuals are paid under two distinct wage structures: the pre-polarisation wage structure that has distribution $F_{Y_0}$ (when $T=0$) and the post-polarisation wage structure, $F_{Y_1}$ (when $T=1$). We wish to compute an overall change $\Delta^\tau$ in the quantile statistic, attributable to changes in work force composition $\Delta^\tau_X$ and changes in the wage structure, $\Delta^\tau_S$:
\begin{align}
  \Delta^\tau_O &= q_\tau(F_{Y_1|T=1}) - q_\tau(F_{Y_0|T=0}) \notag \\
  &= \underbrace{q_\tau(F_{Y_1|T=1}) -  q_\tau(F_{Y_0|T=1})}_{\Delta^\alpha_S} + \underbrace{q_\tau(F_{Y_0|T=1}) - q_\tau(F_{Y_0|T=0})}_{\Delta^\alpha_X} \label{eq:decomp}
\end{align}Notice that this decomposition depends on the availability of a hypothetical counterfactual distribution, $F_{Y_0|T=1}$, wherein the workers of period $1$ are paid according to the wage structure of period~$0$. Although such a distribution cannot be directly observed, \citet{Firpo2011} show that a consistent estimator of $F_{Y_0|T=1}$ can be found by re-weighting $F_{Y_0}$ to have the same distribution as $F_{Y_1}$.

\citet{Firpo2009} demonstrate that the aggregate decomposition, as described in \eqref{eq:decomp}, can be performed using an OLS regression on the recentered influence function of the distributional statistic in question. The recentered influence function is the usual influence function used in the analysis of robust estimators, `recentered' by adding back the value of the distributional statistic. In the case of the quantile function $q_\tau$, the RIF is given by,
$$ RIF(y; q_\tau) = q_\tau + IF(y; q_\tau) = q_\tau + \frac{q_\tau - \mathbf{1}\{y \leq q_\tau\}}{f_Y(q_\tau)}. $$

Then the estimated coefficient $\gamma^{q_\tau}_t$ of an OLS regression of $RIF(y_t; q_\tau)$ on $X$ is
\begin{align*} 
\gamma^{q_\tau}_t &= (E[X \cdot X' | T = t])^{-1} \cdot E[RIF(y_t; q_\tau) \cdot X | T = t]
\intertext{\citet{Firpo2009} show that the distributional statistics themselves can be written as expectations of the conditional RIF, since the expected value of the influence function is zero, and thus $E[RIF(y_t;q_\tau)]=q_\tau$.}
q_\tau(F_t) &= E_X[E[RIF(y_t; q_\tau) | X=x]] = E[X|T=t] \cdot \gamma^{q_\tau}_t
\intertext{And thus we can write \eqref{eq:decomp} in a similar form as \eqref{eq:odecomp},}
\Delta^\alpha_O &= \underbrace{E[X|T=1] \cdot (\gamma^{q_\tau}_1 - \gamma^{q_\tau}_0)}_{\Delta^\alpha_S} + \underbrace{(E[X|T=1] - E[X|T=0]) \cdot \gamma^{q_\tau}_0}_{\Delta^\alpha_X}.
\end{align*}
Under the `ignorability' assumption, discussed below, both of these components of the decomposition are identified.

\subsubsection{Data Requirements for RIF-Regression} \label{sec:id}

One condition required for RIF-regression is that the support of covariates $X$ is the same for both time periods. In other words, it should not be possible to unambiguously predict which time period an observation belongs to, simply by observing the value of its covariates. 
\begin{assumption}[Overlapping support] \label{ass:overlap}
  Let the support of wage setting factors in both periods $[X',\epsilon']'$ be $\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{E}$. For all $[x',e']' \in \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{E}$,  $0 < \Pr[T=0 | X=x, \epsilon=e] < 1$.
\end{assumption}
Importantly, Assumption~\ref{ass:overlap} means that the set of occupational titles in both periods must be the same, even though many new types of occupational titles have been created since 1981-2. Despite to the small sample size, the data are only available at a two-digit level of aggregation, so that none of the occupations listed in the ANZSIC were missing a counterpart from 1981-2. A correspondence was easily found between two-digit ANZSIC groups and 1981-2 occupations, which were available at the three-digit level.

Further, in order to identify the explained and unexplained effects of the covariates, we require that the error term $\epsilon$ has the same conditional distribution in both time periods. This is known as the {\em ignorability} assumption.
\begin{assumption}[Ignorability]
  For $T\in\{0,1\}$, let $(T, X, \epsilon)$ have a joint distribution. Then, for all $x\in \mathcal{X}$, $\epsilon$ is independent of $T$ given $X=x$.
\end{assumption}

The assumptions stated so far are both plausible, and sufficient for identifying the wage structure component ($\hat{\Delta}_S$) and endowment effect component ($\hat{\Delta}_X$) of the aggregate decomposition. While this aggregate decomposition is useful, even more useful would be the ability to separate out the components of $\Delta_X$ or $\Delta_S$ into the contributions of each independent variable, the so-called `detailed decomposition'. 

\citep[p.27]{Fortin2011} show that non-parametric estimates of the detailed decomposition require assumptions that cannot be maintained in this context. For example,the following independence condition, found in \citet{Matzkin2003}, must hold:
\begin{assumption}[Independence]\label{ass:indep}
  For $T\in\{0,1\}$, $X$ is uncorrelated with $\epsilon$ in time $T$.
\end{assumption}
Most decompositions of the determinants of wages, including this one, follow the Mincerean `human capital' approach, which suggests that the primary determinants of wages are investments in education and experience, which enhance productivity \citep{Mincer1962}. For that reason, these covariates are included in $X$ in this study. However, as is well-known, OLS regression estimates of Mincer-style wage equations tend to exhibit endogeneity bias, since observable characteristics (such as years of schooling) tend to be correlated with unobserved characteristics such as general ability or talent \citep{Card1999}. Consequently, any regression specification that omits an accurate measure of `ability' will exhibit endogeneity bias, since the omitted variable will cause explanatory variables such as schooling to be correlated with the error term. That is to say, that the independence property is violated.

However, the impracticality of Assumption~\ref{ass:indep} is avoided by the linear functional form imposed by Assumption~\ref{ass:linear} \citep[p.28]{Fortin2011}. Furthermore, the linear functional form assumption allows for heteroskedasticity. This this application, this is a useful property, since income variance increases with educational attainment.

\subsection{Re-weighting the counterfactual distribution}\label{sec:reweight}

\citet[p.19]{Firpo2011} point out that the RIF-regression described above is a local approximation that may not hold for large variations in covariates $X$. In particular, if the relationship between $Y$ and $X$ is nonlinear, then shifts in the distribution of $X$ may result in different estimates for $\gamma^{q_\tau}_t$ even if $Y$ is invariant. 

Unfortunately, in this application, changes in covariates between period $T=0$ and $T=1$ cannot be assumed to be small. ABS data show that there are considerable differences in the composition of the labour force between 1981-2 and 2009-10 \citep{LFSApr2013}. The average unemployment rate in 1981-2 similar to that of 2009-10 (6.1 per cent versus 5.7 per cent, respectively), but the period was marked by considerable demographic changes. Since the 1980s, women have entered the work force in far greater numbers, and overall labour force participation patterns have varied. Between 1981-2 and 2009-10, the average participation rate for men fell from 77.7 per cent to 72.3 per cent. For women, on the other hand, the participation rate rose from 44.8 per cent to 58.6 per cent. And, for both sexes, the rate of part-time employment has increased dramatically. Clearly, the covariate distributions at both time periods are not directly comparable.

In order to create a comparable counterfactual wage distribution, \citet{Firpo2011} suggest a hybrid approach, where the data in period $0$ are reweighted so that covariates in period $0$ match those in period $1$. Adopting the re-weighting procedure suggested by \citet{DiNardo1996}, they aim to create a counterfactual wage distribution $F_{Y_0}^C$ that exhibits the characteristics of period $0$, but with the wage structure of period $1$:
\begin{align*}
  F_{Y_0}^C &= \int F_{Y_0|X_0}(y|X) dF_{X_1}(X)
\intertext{We now re-write this equation as an integral over $F_{X_0}(X)$, by adding a reweighting factor $\Psi(X) = dF_{X_1}(X)/dF_{X_0}(X)$:}
  F_{Y_0} &= \int F_{Y_0|X_0}(y|X) \Psi(X)dF_{X_0}(X)
\end{align*}
\citet{Fortin2011} show that this re-weighting factor, which is the ratio of two marginal distribution functions, can be manipulated with an application of Bayes' rule to yield a ratio of two binary outcome models:
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:wt}
  \Psi(X) &= \frac{\Pr(T=1|X)/\Pr(T=1)}{\Pr(T=0|X)/\Pr(T=0)},
\end{align*}
that re-weights the data in period $0$ to match the distribution of covariates observed in period~$1$. To implement this re-weighting function, the probability of $T$ being 1 or 0 can be modeled using a probit model, fit to the combined data sets, with $T$ as the response variable. % Probit model: help! How do I weight this?

Using re-weighted data, we can estimate the means of the counterfactual distribution, $\hat{\bar{X}}=\sum_{i|T=0}\hat{\Psi}(X_i) \cdot X_i$, and the coefficients $\hat{\gamma}_{01}^{q_\tau}$ by regressing $RIF(Y_0;q_\tau)$ with the new sample weights. We then rewrite the decomposition \eqref{eq:decomp} as the sum of two separate Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions. The first term, the wage structure effect, is decomposed into a composition effect $\hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau}_{S,p}$ and specification error, $\hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau}_{S,e}$. The second gives a similar decomposition for composition effect:
\begin{align}
  \hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau} &= (\hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau}_{S,p} + \hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau}_{S,e}) + (\hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau}_{X,p} + \hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau}_{X,e}) \notag \\
  &= \underbrace{\left( [\bar{X}_{01} - \bar{X}_0 ] \hat{\gamma}^{q_\tau}_{01} +
    \bar{X}_{01}[\hat{\gamma}_{01}^{q_\tau} - \hat{\gamma}_0^{q_\tau}] \right)}_{\hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau}_{S}} +
  \underbrace{\left( \bar{X}_{1}[\hat{\gamma}_{1}^{q_\tau} - \hat{\gamma}_{01}^{q_\tau}] + 
    [\bar{X}_{1} - \bar{X}_{01} ] \hat{\gamma}^{q_\tau}_{01}\right)}_{\hat{\Delta}^{q_\tau}_{X}}.
\end{align}

This decomposition can be performed on income surveys of repeated cross-sections of the same markets over time.

\section{Data}

To test the theory of changes in the occupational wage profiles outlined above, we require survey data on real wages, as well as detailed measures of the tasks performed by participants of each occupation. For this analysis, we obtained microdata for the Survey of Income and Housing (SIH) for 1981/82, 2000/01 and 2011/12, as well as measures contained in O*NET database, published by the US Department of Labor. Details of both the task measures and SIH are discussed in detail in Sections~\ref{sec:SIH}~and~\ref{sec:onet} of the data appendix. We shall therefore only briefly review the salient features of the data sources as they relate to this analysis. For further details, refer to Appendix~\ref{app:data}.

\subsection{Survey of Income and Housing}

Repeated cross-sectional measures of the income distribution for full-time salaried workers in Australia are computed using data from the SIH. Consistent with previous work, we consider only the subset of respondents who report working full-time, and whose primary source of income are either employer wages and salaries, or who receive income from an unincorporated business. In order to compare the `market value' of skills, we record employee take-home wages (or revenue from an unincorporated business, after tax), including any additional payments such as entitlements, tips, bonuses. Revenue from government payments, investments and so on are ignored. Real incomes are Nominal incomes deflated by the average CPI for the four quarters of the fiscal year spanning the survey.

Changes in the occupational coding schemes pose a challenge. In each of the three surveys considered, the occupational coding schemes are different, and cannot be compared directly. In the 1981/82 survey, occupations are recorded using the 1976 Census Classification and Classified List of Occupations (CCLO) codes. Occupations in the 2000/01 SIH are coded using the 1996 Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO), second edition. And the 2011/12 survey is encoded using the 2006 Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations. (A more detailed discussion of the coding systems employed can be found in Appendix Section~\ref{sec:occcoding}). 

For the purposes of this analysis, the income distribution within occupations (or groups of occupations) of different time periods must be comparable. But in the absence of a classification scheme that permits comparison between periods, it is not possible to analyze changes in subsets of the wage distribution. This challenge is not unique to Australian data: occupational coding systems have changed several times in the post-war era in the United States, for example (see \cite{Autor2012,Meyer2005}).

To facilitate comparison, hybrid classification schemes that merged occupations into comparable groups were developed, and are described in detail in the Appendix. There are two such schemes: {\tt COMBINEDI}, comprising 29 hybrid occupations, for comparing the 1981/82 survey with 2011/12, and {\tt COMBINEDII}, with 28 hybrid occupations, for 2000/01 and 2011/12 (see Tables~\ref{tab:combined1} and~\ref{tab:combined2}). \citet{Firpo2011} employ a similiar number of hybrid groups (40) in their study of occupational wage changes in the United States between 1988 and 2003.

  \caption{Mean occupational weekly wage and task measure index values, at ANZSCO unit group (4-digit) level. The vertical dashed line is drawn at the level of the National Minimum Wage, of \$589.30 per week. Census respondents reporting full-time work are shown. The loess regression line is weighted by population; circle areas are proportional to population for each occupation. Notice that, when occupations are reduced to combined groupings, almost identical trends are observed (c.f. Figure~\ref{fig:meanocc2}). Sources: ABS cat 2072.0, O*NET, US Dept of Labor.}
