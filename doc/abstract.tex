Could technology be responsible for part of the rise of income inequality over the past 30 years?
This research is motivated by the fact that, while technology can make workers more productive, it also has the capacity to put others out of work entirely. We proceed in two parts. First, we consider the standard model of skill-biased technical change, and show that it explains some, but not all, of the trends observed in the data. We then take an alternative approach by considering the task content of occupations, an approach that has been used with success in foreign labor markets. We perform a simple, preliminary test of the relationship between technology investment and polarization, and find a negative relationship between the wage share of middle-skilled workers, and investment in electronic and electrical capital goods.
