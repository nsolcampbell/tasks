\chapter{Skill-biased technical change}

We begin our exploration of income inequality with an analysis of labor-augmenting technology.

\section{Related Literature}

Much of the economic literature views production through the lens of the neoclassical production function, which simply `converts' inputs of capital and labor into an output good. Most formulations of the production function include a `productivity' parameter, that governs the rate at which factors of production are converted into outputs. Solow's (\citeyear{Solow1957}) well-known functional form, $F(K,L,t)=A(t)f(K,L)$, included measures for capital ($K$) and labor ($L$) inputs, but also allowed `technology' ($A(t)$) to vary over time. He deliberately left the definition of technology vague, to simply mean any change in the rate of production: ``all sorts of things will appear as technical change'' \citep[p.312]{Solow1957}.

By inverting his production function and assuming a functional form for $f$, Solow was able to impute values for $A(t)$ as the `residual' output not explained by the neoclassical production function. In his 1957 paper, Solow employed US national accounting statistics for real GDP, capital and labor. Between 1909 and 1949, Solow's estimates for total factor productivity increased more or less monotonically, and by 1949 $A$ had grown to double its initial value. Taken together with Solow's (\citeyear{Solow1956}) model of long-run growth, one important use for Solow's contribution was to spur the field of growth accounting. This approach to studying income spawned a large empirical literature studying the causes of economic growth and development. Today, the neoclassical approach remains an important class of models in the study of the patterns of international income and growth. A prominent example is \citet{Mankiw1992}, which shows that the Solow model, augmented for a measure of human capital, explains cross-country variation in incomes very well indeed.

In the 1980s, empirical evidence from the United States suggested that the rental rate of skilled workers began to grow considerably faster than that of unskilled workers. Until then, wage growth differentials between different skill and educational groups had remained more or less stable. Solow's simple but elegant model, which makes no distinction between different kinds of workers, does not provide any insight into this trend. A number of modifications to the theory were advanced. 

One set of explanations pointed to the changing nature of labor market institutions. \citet{Freeman1994}, for example, suggested that the about 50 per cent of the increase in the `white collar' premium paid to U.S. men could be explained by the decline in the unionization rate. It is widely understood that union bargaining activities result in a narrowing of wage dispersion between unionized workers. He argued that a decrease in the union rate resulted in a loss of worker bargaining power, and thus a decrease in wages. But since unions tend to cover mainly `blue-collar' occupations, then this trend should result in a widening gap between blue- and white-collar work. Yet other explanations for the growing premium paid to skilled workers include sociological factors, such as changes in norms associated with worker pay, \citet{Mitchell1989}. Alternatively, the decline in the density of union workers may simply reflect broader economic trends: changes in the nature and distribution of production activity, for instance.

Such an explanation was advanced by \citet{Murphy1992}, who appeals to changes in the demand structure of US labor as a consequence of trade and competition with overseas producers. The patterns of U.S. trade shifted over the 1980s to trade deficits, favoring the manufacture of goods in low-cost countries, instead of with domestic, high-cost workers. The authors study the relationship between wage rates for white males between 1963 and 1979, and macroeconomic measures of output and wages both in the U.S. and overseas, concluding that changing patterns of trade go a long way to explain changes in the wage structure.

During this debate, some authors argued that technological progress might have softened demand for certain kinds of physical labor. Using logitudinal data gathered from census files, \citet{Davis1991} argue that, though capital investment in automated equipment and machinery, the manufacturing sector  replaced labor-intensive jobs with plant capital. Under this explanation, growing wage differentials between college-educated workers and high school graduates is a result of changes in the demand for labor, as the demand for non-manual work expands, and the demand for manual labor softens. \citet{Krueger1993} expands on this argument, and using microdata on individual workers, finds a premium associated with those occupations that involve computer use.\footnote{For a rather cynical refutation of Krueger's position, see \citet{DiNardo1997}, who show that an effect of a similar magnitude is associated with occupations that use pencils.}

However, the predominant explanation that came to be accepted in the literature is that new technologies, emerging over the post-war era, are complementary to skilled work. \citet{Tinbergen1974,Tinbergen1975} developed a model of the labor market where different kinds of labor were factors in production. Since the time of Adam Smith, it has been well known that the productivity of modern production processes, at any scale, depends crucially on the specialization of labor into a number of different jobs. In Adam Smith's famous study of a pin factory, Smith observed somewhere between a 240-- and 4800--factor increase because of complementarities between different, specialized jobs \citet[I.3]{Smith1910}. Tinbergen recognized that it would be unwieldy to attempt to model every of job using a production function, as the dimensionality of the model would quickly explode. However, armed with the observation that many properties of jobs are highly correlated, he proposed that a good characterization of the labour market can be made by singling out just one or two properties of different jobs. One particularly relevant property of jobs is the degree of {\em schooling} an individual has received. \citet{Tinbergen1974} modeled `graduate' and `unskilled' workers as imperfect substitutes in production, so that firms would seek to employ some number of both types of workers. 

Tinbergen identified two implications of his model. First, since the higher-productivity `graduate' workers were scarce relative to the supply of unskilled workers, graduates would be able to charge employers `scarcity rents,' as well as additional rents for their individual productivity. In the medium run, the availability of these rents would initiate a `race' for investment in education, as unskilled workers seek to enter education in order to access these rents.

Tinbergen's model was further developed by \citet{Katz1992} and others, and brought to bear on the empirical regularity of rising educational returns in the United States and elsewhere, beginning in the 1980s. In their model, they suggest that new workplace technologies disproportionately complement highly-skilled technical and managerial jobs, relative to low-skilled manual and service jobs. Under this explanation, the premium paid to high-skilled labor increases for two reasons: first, since high-skilled workers become relatively more productive, wages to high-skilled occupations are higher at the margin. There is also evidence that, in the United States at least, an increase in the demand for skilled labor, relative to its supply, has resulted in higher wages for skilled occupations. In the jargon, such technologies are said to exhibit \emph{skill bias} \citep{Autor2006}. 

\section{The `Canonical Model' of SBTC}

One formulation of the SBTC model, dubbed the `canonical model' by \citet{Acemoglu2011}, gained wide acceptance in the literature, and was deployed by a large number of authors analyzing skill-biased technology \citep[e.g.]{Katz1992,Goldin2007}. % etc
Before discussing the empirical evidence for SBTC, we will briefly outline the main features and implications of this model, following the notation employed by \citet{Acemoglu2011}

Consider a competitive economy with two different, imperfectly substitutable types of labor: high-skilled and low-skilled. Workers are heterogeneous, with different levels of efficiency within each skill group. Let the total supply of high-skilled labor be $H$, and the total supply of low-skilled labor be $L$, and both types are paid the same wage, respectively $w_h$ and $w_\ell$. Production in this economy is governed by a CES aggregate production function, with elasticity of substitution $\sigma$, where $\sigma>1$:
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:prod}
Y = \left[
  \left(A_LL \right)^\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}
  +
  \left(A_HH \right)^\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}
  \right]^\frac{1}{\sigma-1}.
\end{equation}

For our purposes, we are interested in two claims about relative wages made by this model: first, that technological change or a generalized shift from low-skilled to high-skilled work should never cause low-skilled wages to decrease, and second, that technological change should result in a monotonic increase in wage across the skill spectrum. To see this, we will first derive the expressions for the equilibrium wage for each type of labor. Since the economy is competitive, unique equilibrium wages for both both high- and low-skilled workers are given by their respective marginal products. Wages can therefore be found by differentiating \eqref{eq:prod} with respect to labor supply:
\begin{align}
w_h &= \frac{\partial Y}{\partial H} 
     = A_H^\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}\left(
              A_L^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}} (H/L)^{-\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}} + A_H^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}
        \right)^{\frac{1}{\sigma - 1}} \label{eq:wh} \\
w_l &= \frac{\partial Y}{\partial H} 
     = A_L^\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}\left(
              A_L^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}} + A_H^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}(H/L)^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}
        \right)^{\frac{1}{\sigma - 1}} \label{eq:wl}
\end{align}
The first claim follows from differentiating these wage equations. First, notice in \eqref{eq:wl} that $\partial w_L/\partial A_H \geq 0$. This means that, in this model, an increase in technology for high-skilled workers does not reduce the wage for low-skilled workers. Technological progress should in fact result in positive wage improvements for both high- and low-skilled workers. 

Next, notice that $\partial w_l/\partial(H/L)>0$. An increase in the relative supply of high-skilled workers, $H/L$, should therefore not decrease the wage of low-skilled workers. Rather, as high-skilled work becomes more productive and the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers increases, the demand for low-skilled work simultaneously increases. 

Second, consider the ratio between high- and low-skilled labor, $\omega=w_h/w_l$ (for convenience, we will consider the log ratio.) It is straightforward to show that this ratio depends on the state of technology and labor inputs:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:omega}
\log \omega = \frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}\log\left(\frac{A_H}{A_L}\right) - \frac{1}{\sigma}\log\left(\frac{H}{L}\right).
\end{equation}
This equation illustrates the two countervailing forces of Tinbergen's (1974) `race' for education that govern the magnitude of the skill premium. Holding the labor supply ratio constant, and recalling our assumption that $\sigma >1$, an increase in skill-biased technology $A_H/A_L$ results in a larger $\log\omega$. On the other hand, holding technology constant, an increase in the proportion of workers providing high-skilled labor should decrease the log skill premium.\footnote{Formally, $\partial \log\omega / \partial(A_H/A_L) > 0$, and 
$\partial \log\omega / \partial(H/L) < 0$.} In this model, a rising skill premium occurs when the first term of \eqref{eq:omega}  dominates the second.

To review, the SBTC model claims that unless there is technical regress, wages for all skill types will always increase, and never decrease (wages should follow a monotonic path.) Second, in the presence of an increasing proportion of workers conducting skilled work, the model is consistent with either a rising or a falling log skill premium.

\section{Empirical Evidence for SBTC}

%Between 1960 and the 1980s, the pattern identified by Solow continued: as the economy grew, income accruing to workers steadily increased. In the United States, during this period the composition of the workforce changed as women entered the workforce, and the educational attainment of women and blacks increased. Likewise in Australia, 

Starting in the 1980s, in the United States a divergence between the rental rates of skilled an unskilled labor began to emerge. \citet{Acemoglu2011} report that the `skill premium' paid to college-educated workers remained relatively steady between 1964 and 1980, oscillating in the range of between 48 and 58 per cent, holding other factors constant. However, from 1980, this premium increased steadily 


We will take as a point of departure the standard model for analyzing skill-based technical change (SBTC). This model, dubbed the `canonical' model by \citet{Acemoglu2011} and which has sparked a voluminous literature, has enjoyed considerable empirical success explaining rising wages for high-skill managerial and professional jobs in the United States and Europe \citep{Katz1992}. Since the canonical model includes \emph{factor-augmenting} capital, it predicts a uniform skill upgrading of the work force at all education levels \citep{Levy2003}. Skill upgrading has been confirmed by a number of authors, both in Australia \citep{Esposto2012, Wooden2000, Cully1999} and overseas \citep{Autor2008}. 

\section{Data}

To bring the SBTC model to the data, we employ the Survey of Income and Housing, a hierarchical clustered household survey conducted by the ABS every 2-3 years since 1995, and also for the fiscal years 1985-6 and 1981-2. The survey provides detailed  information about respondents' labor and non-labor income sources, as well as data on age, educational attainment, hours worked and industry and occupation. For the surveys conducted between 2000 and 2010, as well as the 1981-2 survey, the data include detailed occupational data, which will become important later. The other surveys include occupation only at the one-digit level. We obtain survey micro-data as confidentialized unit record files (CURFs).

To facilitate inter-temporal comparisons, we must eliminate effects which arise as a result of mechanical, demographic shifts. Between 1982 and 2010, the number of women in the work force has increased dramatically, and the same period has seen an evolution of the educational and age composition of the work force, and the rate of casual and part-time employment has increased. Following \citet{Acemoglu2011}, we therefore include only full-time workers for whom labor forms the primary source of income. We further composition-adjust each survey to match 2010 demographics by linearly scaling the survey selection weights for each age group/sex/educational group cell. All computations in this study treat these adjusted weights as inverse selection probabilities.

\end{figure}

\section{Results}

If SBTC explained the widening of the income distribution, we would expect to observe the premium accruing to `skilled' labor increasing with time. Figure~\ref{fig:banana} shows the composition-adjusted changes in log real wage by percentile, for males and females, between 1981-82 and 2009-10. If the 1981-82 income percentile can be considered a proxy for skill, then it is apparent that, over this period, wages more grew for high-skill individuals much faster than for low-skill individuals. It would therefore be expected that the premium accruing to higher educational attainment would show a similar trend.

In the United States, at least, the wage premium earned by tertiary-educated labor fell in the 1970s, but has risen each decade since then \citep{Acemoglu2011}. \citet{Katz1992} employs a similar empirical model which explains the rise of the skill premium in the United States in the post-war era. In Australia, however, a corresponding growth in the premium for tertiary qualifications has not been observed. Table~\ref{tbl:wagepremium} shows the log skill premium for Australia and the United States between 1982 and 2008. Rather than any fundamental differences in the nature of the demand for skills, \citet{Coelli2009} attributes this difference in Australian workers to differences in the nature of Australian educational qualifications. In Australia, University degrees are available to a wider range of candidates and for a wider range of disciplines than those who would traditionally have undertaken university studies in the United States. As a result, tertiary educational attainment may be a poor proxy for `skilled' work in Australia.

\end{table}

The SBTC model also claims that, even if technology exhibits skill bias, wages for all skill groups should increase monotonically. Figure~\ref{fig:changetime} plots the cumulative change over time for three wage percentiles, the 5th, 95th, and the median. Over the period 1981-82 to 2009-10, although wages at the top percentiles increased steadily, the same is not true for the lower percentiles. Indeed, for all of the 1990s and much of the 2000s, cumulative real income growth from 1981-82 was negative for many workers.

  \label{fig:changetime}
\end{figure}

That the income distribution is widening, but the skill premium is {\em not} driving the change, suggests one of at least two interpretations. We have already discussed the fact that educational attainment may be a poor indicator of skill for the Australian labor market. A second, more nuanced explanation was given by \citet{Levy2003}. Technological change may not be complementary to all types of labor; it may replace many types of labor entirely.
